1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
   -> Immutable,
   --> A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
   This is similar to declaring variables from within a component

2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
   -> TO mutate our function, add / save / display content
   --> Pass data into component so component can determine what data is displayed

3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
   -> to only access values and not change them
   --> TO maintain some values from within the component, also remember them when react re renders too

4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
   -> States are immutable, immutable means we cannot change existing values
   --> Unchanging.. Props are immutable, State is mutable..
