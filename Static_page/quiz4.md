1. What does the `.map()` array method do?
-> It helps in fetching values when used as props from another file to optimize code
--> returns a new array . whatever we gets returned from the callback function provided is
placed at the same index in new array
    Usually we take the items from original array and modify them in some way

2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?
-> fetch data
--> convert an array of raw data to convert into an array of JSX elements 
that can be displayed on the webpage 


3. Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components
   manually by typing them out?
-> to have dynamic website & not rewriting entire code when we are done
--> it makes the code more "self sustaining" - not requiring additional changes
when the data changes
